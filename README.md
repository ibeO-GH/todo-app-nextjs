# 📝 Todo App (Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind v4)

A fast, modern, and responsive Todo List application built with Next.js (TypeScript), Tailwind CSS v4, and shadcn/ui, featuring offline persistence via Dexie.js (IndexedDB) and React Query for data synchronization.
The app supports searching, filtering, editing, deleting, pagination, and detailed todo pages — all within a clean, accessible UI.

Note: This is the Next.js version of the Todo App.

Current Branch (nextjs-version) → Built with Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui

Previous Branch (typescript-version) → Built with React + Vite + TypeScript

- npm run build - Build the app for production.
- npm run start - Run the production build locally.
- npm run lint - Run ESLint checks.

---

## 🧱 Technology Stack

- Framework - Next.js 16 (App Router)
- Language - TypeScript
- Styling - Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui
- State & Data - TanStack Query (React Query)
- Database - Dexie.js (IndexedDB offline persistence)
- Deployment – Vercel
- Icons - Lucide React

---

## 🧠 Architecture & Decisions

- Next.js App Router - Provides file-based routing, server components, and better performance.

- React Query - Handles caching, background updates, and mutation efficiently.

- Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui - Provides design consistency and modern, responsive styling.

- Dexie.js – Enables offline-first data storage and persistence via IndexedDB.

- Error Boundaries - Ensures graceful handling of runtime or route-level errors.

---

## 📡 API & Data Flow

Although designed to use [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), for demo data, all CRUD operations are persisted offline using IndexedDB.

- Endpoints (fo reference)

GET /todos

- Fetches a list of todos (limited to 20 items)

GET /todos/:id

- Fetches a single todo by ID.

---

## Query Flow

- useQuery() - Reads todos from IndexedDB

- useMutation() - Handles create/update/delete actions

- On mutation, queries are invalidated to auto-refresh the UI

---

## Local Database (Dexie.js)

- todos: Stores active todo items objects (userId, id, title, completed).
- deletedTodos: Tracks deleted API todos.

CRUD operations are handled in:

- src/db/todoDb.ts
- src/app/page.tsx
- src/app/todos/[id]/page.tsx
- src/components/TodoDetail.tsx

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues

- ❗ No drag-and-drop reordering.

- ❗ No cloud sync – data stored in the browser.

- ❗ IndexedDB data is cleared when browser storage is wiped.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Drag-and-drop reordering

- Cloud sync via Firebase/Supabase

- Light/Dark theme toggle

- Due dates & priority labels

- Export/import todos as JSON/CSV

- Lazy loading for large datasets

## Migration Notes (React + Vite → Next.js)

This version was migrated from React + Vite (TypeScript) to Next.js 16 (App Router) for improved structure and scalability.

Key Changes
Area React + Vite Next.js Version
Routing Manual with TanStack Router File-based routing via src/app
Entry Point main.tsx layout.tsx and page.tsx
Build Tool Vite Next.js (Webpack/Turbopack)
Dev Port 5173 3000
Metadata index.html head tags export const metadata in layout.tsx
Error Handling Custom ErrorBoundary Built-in error.tsx + fallback UI
Pagination & Data Same logic preserved Fully compatible via use client components
Offline Persistence Dexie.js (same) Dexie.js (migrated with Next.js client hooks)
Styling Tailwind v4 Tailwind v4 (identical config)

All core logic, UI, pagination, and CRUD behaviors remain exactly the same as the TypeScript version — just restructured for Next.js’s App Router.
